                        APY refers to Annual Percentage Yield. It utilises a real rate of return through compounding
                        interest. If you have a $100 investment with an APY of 1000%, then 365 days later your
                        investment will be $1100.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For an illustrative example, look at the graph below. This graph assumes that a user stakes 10
                        MUSH tokens and gains a reliable 1% daily return.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As you can see, APY returns become exponential over time because rewards are compounding, so a
                        long-term staking strategy can be very profitable.

                        APY relies on the sale of DAI bonds in order to mint new MUSH tokens. If sufficient bonds are
                        sold, then high APY rates are sustainable. If the protocol aims for 10,000% APY, and 10,000 MUSH
                        tokens are staked, 200 MUSH tokens need to be minted daily in order to achieve the APY; (Roughly
                        2% growth a day). If there are at least 200 MUSH tokens brought into the protocol from bond
                        sales, the APY is sustainable.

                        <br />
                        The APY can be high due to compounding interest. Funds are auto staked everyday to generate
                        exponential growth.
